               Hyper-Personalized Medicine Safety at Your Fingertips
================================================================================

THE PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every year, 1.3 million Americans are injured by medication errors. Adverse drug
reactions cause 125,000+ deaths annually in the US alone—making it the 4th
leading cause of death. Yet most patients have no way to know if a medication
is safe for THEM specifically.

Current solutions fail because:
  - Drug labels show population-level risks, not personalized ones
  - Pharmacists catch only 2% of dangerous drug interactions
  - Patients self-medicate with OTC drugs unaware of their personal risk factors
  - Existing apps provide generic information, not individualized assessments

THE OPPORTUNITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$45B+    Global medication safety market (2024)
1.5B+    OTC drug purchases annually in the US alone
350M+    Chronic disease patients worldwide needing ongoing medication guidance
82%      Of adults take at least one medication; 29% take 5+ medications

THE SOLUTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SafeMed is an AI-powered platform that provides instant, personalized medication
safety assessments. Users input their health profile once, then check any drug
by name or photo to receive:

  [1] Personal Safety Score (0-100) based on THEIR unique risk factors
  [2] Hard-stop contraindications specific to their conditions
  [3] Drug-drug interaction alerts with their current medications
  [4] Personalized side effect risks (not population averages)
  [5] Dosing recommendations adjusted to their health status
  [6] Safer alternative suggestions when risks are elevated

TECHNICAL EDGE / MOAT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike generic drug information apps, SafeMed's risk engine uses a proprietary
5-phase assessment algorithm:

  Phase 1: Absolute Contraindications
           ICD-10 mapped conditions, allergy cross-reactivity, pregnancy rules

  Phase 2: Drug-Drug Interactions
           Major/moderate/minor severity with mechanism-based scoring

  Phase 3: Demographic Risk Multipliers
           Age-adjusted risks, renal function (eGFR), cardiovascular history

  Phase 4: Personalized Side Effects
           SIDER database (100+ effects per drug) filtered and ranked by
           user-specific risk factors with adjusted probability multipliers

  Phase 5: Dynamic Recommendations
           Tier-based dosing, monitoring requirements, alternatives

KEY DIFFERENTIATORS:
  - Clinical-grade data: SIDER 4.1, MedDRA, ICD-10 taxonomies
  - Hybrid AI architecture: Deterministic engine + LLM fallback for any drug
  - Multi-modal input: Text, brand names, photo recognition (Gemini Vision)
  - Cumulative risk scoring: Not binary yes/no, but nuanced 0-100 scale
  - Real-time personalization: Side effect probabilities multiplied by
    individual risk factors (e.g., 2.5x GI risk for elderly + history)

PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Frictionless UX: Apple Health-inspired dark interface
  - Zero account required: Privacy-first, no data persistence
  - Sub-second analysis: Backend risk engine with pre-computed lookup tables
  - Extensible architecture: Easy addition of new drugs to registry
  - Cloud-native: Containerized FastAPI backend on Google Cloud Run

BUSINESS MODEL POTENTIAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  B2C Freemium     Premium subscriptions for unlimited checks + family profiles
  B2B Enterprise   API licensing to pharmacies, telehealth, insurers
  B2B2C Partnerships   White-label for health systems and PBMs
  Data Insights    Anonymized, aggregated medication safety trends

GO-TO-MARKET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Phase 1: Consumer app targeting self-medicating adults (OTC focus)
  Phase 2: Chronic disease communities (diabetes, cardiovascular, arthritis)
  Phase 3: Healthcare provider integrations (EHR plugins, pharmacy POS)
  Phase 4: International expansion (regulatory pathways in EU, UK, Canada)

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Drugs.com/WebMD       Generic info, no personalization, ad-heavy
  Epocrates             Clinician-focused, not consumer-friendly
  Medisafe              Adherence-focused, limited safety analysis

  SafeMed Advantage:    Only solution combining clinical-grade data with
                        AI-powered personalization for consumers

TRACTION / MILESTONES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [x] Core risk engine built with ibuprofen + salbutamol coverage
